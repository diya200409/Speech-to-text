A real-time speech-to-text and translation system that allows users to speak in any language and automatically converts the speech into English text. The English output can then be translated into multiple other languages, similar to Google Translate.

The system is built using browser-based speech recognition and a Flask backend, and follows a clean, real-time, and privacy-first approach. It efficiently handles multilingual and mixed-language speech (e.g., Hinglish), making it suitable for diverse real-world communication scenarios.
